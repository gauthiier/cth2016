## Final Projects 

### Group 01

__Team members:__ 

Rahul & Randy

__Name of the project: __

Let’s meet..

__What is the concept:__

We are going to create a program that combines the Twitter geolocation with a Geomap server (Google Maps, for instance). How about a web-interface that searches for two tweeters that share a hashtag, and give them a route navigation to each other? Bringing people around the world together, whether they’re having a tweet feud or share common interests. Our focus once again, will be on the now past election and thus Hillary or Donald related hashtags. Let’s reunite!

__Inspiration / examples (links, url if applicable):__

- [http://tweetedtrips.com/](http://tweetedtrips.com/) which is a program that generates travel routes through hashtag use. This is very applicable to what we are planning on creating. 

- Inspiration also came from the fact that we wanted to use Google Maps since it has a beautiful interface and it seemed fun to combine it with a more social media-esque website such as twitter. 


__Which technology / method are you planning on using:__

- Twitter API – to find hashtags.

- Google Maps API – to display the route.

- Javascript to generate the functions.

- HTML to create the interface.


__Who is doing what in the team:__

We’ll continue on each others work, which is quite easy since we’re housemates. We might divide the work that needs to be done through the Twitter and the Google Maps API code. Randy will provide cups, while Rahul boils water. Each session the oracle will tell us who’s providing tea.

__Team members:__ Inés & Johnny

__Name of the project:__

Literacy Links

__What is the concept:__

We will program an educational program to assist teachers in creating reading resources for their students. The program will intake text from a user interface and the alter the text, swapping out words for other words using a thesaurus API. It will then output a text that should have the same message, just using different words. 

__Inspiration / examples (links, url if applicable):__

We were inspired by a site called Newsela, which posts news articles at different reading levels for students. Unfortunately, however, this process isn't automated and requires individuals to read and then rewrite the articles. We hope to create a program that will automate this process in order to make it quicker and applicable to any article, not only the ones selected by the Newsela writers.

__Which technology / method are you planning on using:__

We will use html to set up an interface and then javascript to create the physical program. The program will take in a plain text file and then feed the individual words into an array. Then we will use loops to go through the array and then determine what kinds of words are in each position. If the words are adjectives, adverbs, or verbs, we will utilize the thesaurus API to swap out the words with other words.  

__Who is doing what in the team:__

As of right now, Johnny will be in charge of the interface and I will be in charge of the program that substitutes words.

__Name of the project: __

Harry Potter Fortune Quiz

__What is the concept:__

We're going to make a quiz based on the Harry Potter-universe, but we will especially use the fortunes given in the books. We're going to create a webpage where you can play the quiz - it will contain around 15 questions. The program gives you a fortune and three possible answers. It will tell you right away whether you were right or wrong. 

__Inspiration / examples (links, url if applicable):__

We came up with the idea after talking about Harry Potter and the online quiz-program Kahoot. 

__Which technology / method are you planning on using:__

The same as in class - javascript and HTML.

__Who is doing what in the team:__

We are trying to do it all together, because the last assignment showed us that we work really well as a team.

__Name of the project:__

The HONY search machine project

__What is the concept:__

We want to make the individual stories and photos of the HONY (Humans of New York) project searchable via a search-engine and we want to show the results in an interface on a server. We will make use of the Instagram API to enable the searchengine.

__Which technology / method are you planning on using:__

We want to use the twitterscraping idea that was shown in the last lessons, as well as using .js with options (such as gender) and showing the options via an index.html connection to a server.

__Who is doing what in the team:__

Not specified yet at this moment.

__Name of the project: __

Spotify Randomizer

__What is the concept:__

For this final project we would like to create a randomizer for Spotify where you can pick a genre and the Spotify recommendation system will then randomly choose a song for you.

__Inspiration / examples (links, url if applicable):__

???

__Which technology / method are you planning on using:__

For this, we would have to request the Spotify API, which will enable us to obtain data from the Spotify music catalog and manage our playlists and saved music.

__Name of the project:__

Road trip generator

__What is the concept:__

Our application will allow the user to input a destination and will suggest a road trip to the user. It will show the user all the sights on the route they want to travel. 

The user will be able to plan a route with the app. The user inputs a place of departure and a destination and the app will suggest a route to travel. This route contains both the travel information as suggestions for sightseeing along the way. The user will be able to see some information about the different sights on the route they want to travel and see a picture of the sight.


__Inspiration / examples (links, url if applicable):__



__Which technology / method are you planning on using:__

- Using the Google Maps API to create a route planner.

- Using the Google Places API and the points_of_interest label to collect sights on a route.

- Using the Instagram API to connect pictures to sights on the route.

- Combine the use of these API’s in an interface for the user.

- Create an attractive front end and make it user friendly with a clear overview.
