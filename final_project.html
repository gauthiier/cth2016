<h1 class="title">CTH-2016 / Final Project</h1>
</header>
<p>The final project is the final instalment of the CTH-2016 course. The project is a group assignment whose topic is open ended for you to choose though it must relate to some of the methods and techniques you have learned in class.</p>
<p>Each group must create a final project portfolio, which consists of a repository on Github. The deadline to hand in this portfolio is week 7 (14/12). In addition, the project needs to be presented by the members of your group in class during week 7. The duration of the presentation is expected to be 10 mins and 5 mins is allocated for a Q&amp;A (Questions &amp; Answers). A successful presentation will include a demonstrated ability to field questions from the audience.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>The final project itself (referred to as 'project portfolio') is worth 45% of your final grade for the entire course, while the project's presentation amounts to 10%.</p>
<p>Below are evaluation criteria for the portfolio and a presentation 'guideline' to help you prepare your class intervention.</p>
<h4 id="project-portfolio-45-points">Project Portfolio (45 points)</h4>
<p><strong>Concept &amp; User Interface (15 points)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the concept of the project sound?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the user interface(s) of the project developed enough so to convey (1) the functionality of the produced software and (2) the concept the project aims to put forth?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Execution &amp; Efficiency (15 points)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the code work and executes as intended?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the code efficient in its use of programming techniques and methods introduced in class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure &amp; Documentation (15 points)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the code structured and legible (layout of the code, meaningful variable names, etc.)?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the code and the project properly documented (inline comments, README, etc.)?</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="presentation-10-points">Presentation (10 points)</h4>
<p><strong>Duration: 15 mins total -- 10 mins presentation + 5 mins questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Concept: What is your projectâ€™s name and concept? Why did you choose this concept?</p></li>
<li><p>Demo: How does your prototype function? How does one interact with the software?</p></li>
<li><p>Techniques: What are the programming methods and techniques employed?</p></li>
<li><p>Reflection: What parts of the project were difficult (and/or easy) to build and why? What could/would you have done differently? How were the team dynamics within your group?</p></li>
</ul>
