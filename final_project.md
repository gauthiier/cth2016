title: CTH-2016 / Final Project
---

The final project is the final instalment of the CTH-2016 course. The project is a group assignment whose topic is open ended for you to choose though it must relate to some of the methods and techniques you have learned in class. 

Each group must create a final project portfolio, which consists of a repository on Github. The deadline to hand in this portfolio is week 7 (14/12). In addition, the project needs to be presented by the members of your group in class during week 7. The duration of the presentation is expected to be 10 mins and 5 mins is allocated for a Q&A (Questions & Answers). A successful presentation will include a demonstrated ability to field questions from the audience.

### Grading

The final project itself (referred to as 'project portfolio') is worth 45% of your final grade for the entire course, while the project's presentation amounts to 10%.

Below are evaluation criteria for the portfolio and a presentation 'guideline' to help you prepare your class intervention.

####Project Portfolio (45 points)

__Concept & User Interface (15 points)__

* Is the concept of the project sound?

* Is the user interface(s) of the project developed enough so to convey (1) the functionality of the produced software and (2) the concept the project aims to put forth?

__Execution & Efficiency (15 points)__

* Does the code work and executes as intended?

* Is the code efficient in its use of programming techniques and methods introduced in class?

__Structure & Documentation (15 points)__

* Is the code structured and legible (layout of the code, meaningful variable names, etc.)?

* Is the code and the project properly documented (inline comments, README, etc.)?

####Presentation (10 points)

__Duration: 15 mins total -- 10 mins presentation + 5 mins questions__

* Concept: What is your projectâ€™s name and concept? Why did you choose this concept?

* Demo: How does your prototype function? How does one interact with the software?

* Techniques: What are the programming methods and techniques employed?

* Reflection: What parts of the project were difficult (and/or easy) to build and why? What could/would you have done differently? How were the team dynamics within your group?
