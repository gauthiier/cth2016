## Course Synopsis / Description

In this module students will learn how to read and write computer code. Rather than writing discursive texts to address certain cultural artefacts, as it is usually and rightly practiced in the Humanities, students learn how to write software to perform machinic readings of these artefacts. By learning how to write code in a contemporary programming language and how to interpret the workings and effects of their programs, students develop a type of literacy that allow them to conduct novel types of Humanities observations, explorations and expressions when addressing contemporary culture and its digitally mediated objects and subjects. 

At the end of the course the student is able to:

* Apply knowledge of basic programming skills that carry over to almost all programming languages
* Demonstrate a comprehension of software’s composition and functioning that goes beyond its mere usage
* Demonstrate a basic knowledge of natural language processing and automatic text generation
* Demonstrate knowledge of contemporary browser-based scripting and client-server networking
* Demonstrate a critical understanding of the place code and software literacy has within the Humanities
* Reflect on experience in project-based collaborative humanities research

## Assignments

* [Assignment #1: Bookstore (CLI)](./assignments.html)
* [Assignment #2: (Love) Letters](./assignments.html)
* [Assignment #3: Localhost's Imitation Game](./assignments.html)

Each individual assignment will be posted on the day of the class (weeks 1, 2, 3).

## Final Project

* [Final Project Evaluation Criteria](./final_project.html)

The final project is a group project that needs to be presented and handed in in the final week of the course (week 7). The topic of the project is open for you to decide but must be signed off by the instrutor not later than two weeks (week 5) before the presentation.

## Assessment / Grading

Grading for the module consists of (1) three assigments scheduled to be delivered during first part the block and (2) a final group project that will be presentated during the last session of the semester. 

* Assignment #1 (15%) - due week 2 (08/11/16 13:00)
* Assignment #2 (15%) - due week 3 (15/11/16 13:00)
* Assignment #3 (15%) - due week 4 (22/11/16 13:00)
* Final group project (45% — individually graded) - due week 7 (14/12/16)
* 15-minute presentation of final project (10% — individually graded) (14/12/16)

Assignments are handed in on the day before the next scheduled session, that is, __Tuesday at 13:00__ at the latest. Assignments are graded on three aspects: 1) does the code work and execute as intended, 2) is the code clearly structured and documented and 3) is the code efficient.

The final project and presentation is a group assignment. Groups will be arranged at the start of the semester on week 2 and each group will give a short pitch of their final project on week 4. Students are free to choose their topic, but must gain approval at least two weeks in advance of the final project's due date (14/12).

Each group must create a final project portfolio (a repository on Github). The deadline to hand in this portfolio is week 7 (14/12). The final project presentation also takes place in week 7. A successful presentation will include a demonstrated ability to field questions from the audience.
